## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

5) Spotify

APP IDEA
One idea is like a show or anime tracker. It would be an improvement from the myanimelist(MAL) app which tracks what anime the user has watched or currently watching. Besides being able to rate and track animes, the MAL app shows what animes are being aired whether currently and in the future and provides a synopsis and related info about the anime. An improvement would be taking the features that spotify has where it can create a recomended list of animes for the user. 

Or an app that functions like a nutrition tracker that also reminds the user when to eat. It would take in the users physical traits(height, weight etc) sleeping pattern,when they wake up, when they sleep, what they are eating and the amount of calories and nutrients it correlates. reminding the user throughtout the day of when they should eat again and what nutrients they are missing. At the end of the day showing a summary or foods and nutrional intake.
## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
Had some intial issues with dragging the connection to the view cntroller file,issue was that the file wasn't the correct view controller file.
